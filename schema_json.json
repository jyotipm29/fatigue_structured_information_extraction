As a result, many studies refer to the fatigue strength  at a defined high cycle count (e.g., 10^6-10^7 cycles) as the \"fatigue limit\" or \"endurance limit\"; however, this is  technically the fatigue strength at the cycle limit, not a true endurance limit.\nThe presence of test data showing that specimens survive well beyond an apparent knee point on the S-N curve can be  seen as a strong indicator for a true endurance limit to be existent.\nNote: If a 'fatigue_endurance_limit_value' exists, it must also be assigned as the 'fatigue_strength_at_cycle_limit_value'.",
